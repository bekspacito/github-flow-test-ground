The Github flow scenarios testing ground. 
The project itself is an simple calculator in java that supports only 4 basic binary operations(+,-,/,*) and excepts an input from command line arguments.
For example : 
	$ java Calc + 2 5
	Output : 7

Usefull commands : 
	Clone project's single branch:
		- git clone [url] --branch [branch] --single-branch

Notes:
	1. When you run [git pull origin master], what happens is :
		- all remote branches get updated
		- merges into current branch the remote branch 'master'
